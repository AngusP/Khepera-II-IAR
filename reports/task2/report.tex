\begin{abstract}
  We present an implementation of an algorithm similar to \textit{Bug2}\cite{principlesrobot} 
  built atop reactive obstacle collision avoidance and edge following behaviour developed for 
  \textit{Task1}. The existing architecture is extended to include storing timestamped poses 
  in a Redis\cite{Redis} key/value \& pubsub server, goal state publishing and real-time visualisation 
  using a Redis to ROS\cite{ROS} pipe, odometry, sensory information and goals
  are displayed graphically in Rviz. After-the-fact plotting is provided with MatPlotLib independent
  of ROS.

  In our testing, the robot was able to navigate to within 10cm of the origin (it's start point) 
  from an abitary location in multiple environments successfully in ${12/15}$ experiments, where each 
  environment was designed to evoke edge-case behaviour considered hard for the algorithm. The 
  algorithm performs comparably in a static world and a dynamic one in which other actors 
  (e.g. Humans) present a transient obstacle.

\section{Introduction}

The second IAR assignment entails extending the existing systems from Task 1 with Odometry, 
to maintain an estimate of the robot's location, enabling rendering of it's movement both 
in real time and after completion. The task also calls for `Return to home' ability, either 
``by retracing its outward route or more directly''. As an extention, basic mapping (without
filtering to correct for odometry dead-reckoning drift) of the world is desireable. We utilise 
Rviz, a popular graphical tool for ROS to live-render the Khepera Robot's pose, odometry trail,
obstacles perceived by the IR range sensors and goal (a plan-line to the origin).
